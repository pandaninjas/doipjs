## About Keyoxide

[Keyoxide](https://keyoxide.org/), made by Yarmo Mackenbach, is a modern, secure and privacy-friendly platform to establish decentralized online identities using a novel concept know as [DOIP](doip.md). In an effort to make this technology accessible for other projects and stimulate the emergence of both complementary and competing projects, this project-agnostic library is [published on codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/keyoxide/doipjs) and open sourced under the [Apache-2.0](https://codeberg.org/keyoxide/doipjs/src/branch/main/LICENSE) license.

## Community

There's a [Keyoxide Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#keyoxide:matrix.org) where we discuss everything DOIP and Keyoxide.
